# Big-Mart-Sales

## Problem-statement
BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products. Same is the case with each store.

To build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.

## Approach to this Project
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
* Data preprocessing includes, missing value imputation, removing skewness,scaling numeric variables,label encoding and one hot enconding for categorical variables.
* Implemented different models like Linear Regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Random Forest and XGBoost and evaluated the models based on RMSE.
